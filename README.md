# Ultimate Hackathon Starting Guide

## What is this?
The *Ultimate Hackathon Starting Guide* is an all-purpose, one-stop guide to hackathons. Whether you are a first time hacker or an experienced professional, we believe that this guide can help you build the best project possible!

## How do I navigate around?
In the various folders, you will find tips and resources for a variety of topics. In our experience, these are the most useful technologies at a hackathon. Click on the folder you are interested in and start hacking!

If you are an absolute beginner, welcome to your first hackathon! If you want to learn about what to expect from a hackathon checkout the [hackathon logistics](https://github.com/kdesai2018/ultimate-hackathon-starting-guide/tree/master/hackathon-logistics) guide. On the technical side, we'd recommend checking out the [terminal](https://github.com/kdesai2018/ultimate-hackathon-starting-guide/blob/master/getting-started-terminal/README.md) guide first, and then moving on to the [Github starter guide](https://github.com/kdesai2018/ultimate-hackathon-starting-guide/blob/master/getting-started-github/README.md).

## Who made this?
This resource was made by [Freetail Hackers](http://freetailhackers.com/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](utexas.edu). We are a multidisciplinary student organization organizes [HackTX](http://hacktx.com/) annually. :heart:

## What was the inspiration for this guide?
Our entire team is currently quarantining at home. With this abundance of free time, we decided to create a tool that would be useful for hackathons attendees and organizers around the world. 

## Other useful general tutorials
Our goal with this project is to help beginners learn as quickly as possible. Part of achieving this goal means sharing as many high quality tutorials as we can. Usually, we will link these tutorials within their respective sections. However, we will link more general, multi-purpose tutorials down below. Hopefully these sources will supplement your learning :smile:

1. A team of PhD students at MIT created a course called "The Missing Semester". This is a really good guide into the fundamentals of CS tools, and is well worth a read. However, it is quite long and may not be appropriate if you are just trying to learn a single topic for a hackathon. Check it out [here](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)

## I found a mistake // How can I get involved?
